CS510 Rust Programming - HW2
Author: Haomin He
Homework 2 (http://moodle.svcs.cs.pdx.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=787)

I finished the homework 2. It is pretty challenging since it is a new language to me. 
I have spent a lot of time learning, researching and debugging. The textbook and on-line
researches helped me a lot. The rust online playground helped me debugging small parts of 
my code.  
I have learned a lot from this homework. For instance, I learned how to write helper 
functions if needed, what rust data structure to use, and etc.
